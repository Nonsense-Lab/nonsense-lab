# nonsense-lab
The name of this repository, **nonsense-lab**, is self-explanatory, just as I said in the short comment.
<br>
It's written in C++, and Linux/Mac OS users may use `g++` to compile and run all of the applications in your machine.
<br>
Besides, for Windows users, there is always a 32-bit version of the application that is ready to run to download.

# Written
**GR** : A keystring generator which only depends on the random functions provided in `<random>` and `<cstdlib>`.
